# nvim config todo

- [x] make inactive windows dimmed on onedark theme
- [x] make `gd` "go to definition" work, and `gf` too for files references in typescript alias (resolution via lsp?)
- [x] when clicking something on the tree with multiple windows, use the last active one, don't ask A/B/C/...
- [ ] remove onedark theme lock to v0.1.0 when [#251][1] is fixed, and run `:Lazy update`
